## Garden Days

Our regular gardening days are held on the last Sunday of every month from 11am to 1pm. They’re casual, open to all, and there’s always lots to do around the garden for all ages and abilities. But mostly it’s just an excuse to get together and enjoy the terrace together. Bring a picnic (or cocktail) and pop on down!
 
+ Watering & Weeding
+ Pruning flowers & shrubs
+ Harvesting herbs, fruit and vegetables
+ Planting in new bulbs and plants and sowing seeds

## Enjoy the Herb & Veggies

Everything planted on the terrace is there for all to enjoy. For more information on what you might find and how to harvest it see the articles under [Latest News](https://qn7gardening.github.io/articles/).
