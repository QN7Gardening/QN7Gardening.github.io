You're invited! Join us this **Sunday July 30, 2017** from **11AM onwards** down on the communal terrace where we'll be putting on a casual BYO BBQ & Picnic!  

It's also our [regular monthly gardening day](https://qn7gardening.github.io/articles/GardeningDays/) so a perfect time to meet some neighbours, enjoy the terrace, get your hands dirty, and sample some of the fruit, herbs & veg we've actually managed to eke out down there! 

The [Gustav's Salad Lettuce](https://www.rhshumway.com/P/02527/Gustav%27s+Salad+Lettuce) in particular is ripe for salads right now and with any luck there may be some fresh strawberries and maybe even a few new potatoes!

So bring a dish, your favourite tipple and something to throw on the grill and we'll see you down there!
